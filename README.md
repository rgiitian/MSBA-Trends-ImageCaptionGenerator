### Project Overview
The goal of this application framework is to quickly evaluate a new image and generate a written statement that captures the main objects within the image as well as the main actions occurring within the image. The proposed process will record the image, and generate a caption for trend analysis or further data processing. This caption generating pipeline was implemented through Amazon's cloud computing pipeline infrastructure through the use of S3, sageMaker, and Lambda.

### Data and Classification Model
The training data consisting of 8100 images and image descriptions, provided by Flickr, and the machine learning model used in this demonstration of AWS implementation were accessed via the following GitHub link: https://github.com/dabasajay/Image-Caption-Generator

### AWS Implementation of Model

### Proposed Process Description - For Full AWS Deployment
Process Description
1. AWS S3: The captured images are uploaded into the S3 bucket
2. AWS SageMaker: The model is trained based on the training data recieved. The trained model is then  saved in the S3 bucket for later image caption generation
3. AWS Lambda: New images uploaded to the S3 bucket are vectorized and predicted via the previoulsy trained model also stored in the S3 bucket.
4. AWS S3: the predicted captions are then stored in an S3 bucket for further pipeline deployment depending on the specific use case desired. Potential examples of further deployment include storing the captions in a queryable database, using Sagemaker for further model training, or using lambda for further data transformations.
